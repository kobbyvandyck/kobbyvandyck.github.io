I am pursuing a Ph.D. in the [University of Notre Dame Biophysics Graduate Program](https://biophysics.nd.edu) with [Dr. Katharine White](https://sites.nd.edu/whitelab/lab-members/katharine-white/), researching how pH dynamics allosterically regulate signaling proteins (2020-TBD). I am interested in how transient changes in intracellular pH affect the activity and function of these proteins that regulate these cellular events. My research goal is to characterize the pH sensing mechanisms of cytosolic proteins that contain networks of ionizable residues. I am particularly interested the pH sensing of SH2 domain containing proteins like phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K). The distribution of ionizable residues in these SH2 domain proteins reflect how these proteins might have adapted to the tight regulation of intracellular pH.

I received my bachelors in [Cell and Molecular Biology from the DePauw University](https://www.depauw.edu/academics/departments-programs/biology/), where I worked with [Dr. Pascal Lafontant](https://sites.google.com/depauw.edu/lafontantlab/home) on comparative cardiac regeneration(2018-2020). I also worked on studying how the cellular environment played a role in regulating protein stability and dynamics(2018-2020) in Dr. Emily Guinn’s lab. During the summer of 2018, I participated in an [Undergraduate Research Internship](https://neurodata.io/about/alum.html) at [John’s Hopkins University](https://neurodata.io), where I worked with [Dr. Joshua Vogelstein](https://neurodata.io/about/jovo/)(2018). In the Neurodata Lab, I visualized and analyzed neuroimaging datasets including EEG and fMRI. 

Outside research, I enjoy making art, reading African Literature, and playing video games.
